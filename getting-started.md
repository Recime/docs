Enter title, description of the of the bot. Upload an icon (256x256), choose your channel and language. 

Press "Submit".

This will create a bot using the default template with `start`, `default` and `about` block. 

Blocks are the building blocks of your bot. A block contains expressions and responses. You can also trigger a block by a user event (e.g.button click) or by user input.


Go to the "Responses" tab, make some changes and test your bot in real-time.

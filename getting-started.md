# Getting Started

You will first build the elements you need to make the Facebook chat bot with Flickr photoâ€™s work, make sure you have prepped your system as mentioned before.


You will:

> Create the bot files

> Get a Flickr API key

> Add the API to the bot code

> Deploy the bot

> Create a Facebook page \(mandatory for all FB bots\)

> Create a Facebook App ID \(Facebook developer\)

> Connect the Facebook App ID to the Facebook page

> Connect the Recime bot to the Facebook App ID



So at one point you will have multiple screens open, but we promise, all will come together at the end!

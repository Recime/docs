# Create Facebook Page

Next is prepping your bot for Facebook. You need two things: A Facebook Page on facebook.com for your bot and a developers App ID on the Facebook Developers website. The first step is to [create the facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/) page for your bot. Log in to [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) and select “add page” on the top right arrow menu. (This is a required step for all facebook messenger apps).

Choose a suitable category (for instance Entertainment) and fill in the facebook requirements, use a unique name and profile picture so you can easily find it later on in messenger and pick the correct page (there are already many “Hello World” pages ;)….).

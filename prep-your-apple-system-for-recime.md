We wonâ€™t take a view of what code editor you use. Just make sure you have one like [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text ](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)and configure the editor to your liking

## **Recime package**

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) by pasting the below command at a Terminal prompt: \(_this can take a few minutes_\) `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

To install all the Go and Recime CLI, just run the following command, Homebrew takes care of the rest for you: `brew tap recime/tools && brew install recime-cli`

This can take a few minutes, it will install all the dependencies, configure path and install the CLI accessible globally. Once installation is complete, type `recime-cli` to verify:

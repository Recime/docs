# Create Facebook Page

 In order to run your recime bot on `Facbook Messenger Platform` you need a `Facebook Page on facebook.com` and a developers App ID. The first step is to [create the facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create/) for your bot. Log in to [www.facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) and select “add page” on the top right arrow menu. (This is a required step for all facebook messenger apps).

Choose a suitable category (for instance Entertainment) and fill in the facebook requirements, use a unique name and profile picture so you can easily find it later on in messenger and pick the correct page (there are already many “Hello World” pages ;)….).

# Prepping your system

We support cross OS platform development, prepping your system is per platform a bit different. But the requirements are the same.

To get started, you will need:
> A Code editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/)

> [Go](https://golang.org/) installed and configured
The `Recime Command Line Tool`, installed, and configured

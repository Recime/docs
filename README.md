# Introduction

After this tutorial you will have built your own working bot. You'll use Recime, a javascript framework and cloud based service, to build cross-platform bots. Recime bots are Node modules therefore it has the similar `npm` structure and it is possible to use existing npmjs.org modules out of the box.

Typically building bots requires a developer to spin up their own Node server, wire up the corresponding SDKs, manually integrate NPL, fiddle with API access tokens, and then host it all somewhere by yourself. Recime (/ˈresəˌmē/) is a cloud based bot infrastructure backend and hosting platform for developers (BoTaaS). Recime handles all the plumbing a bot developer runs into and provides with its javascript framework all the required infrastructure necessary to build a rich bot with built-in natural language processing. It will save you hours of development hours.

At Recime you can build bots with different functions, for instance a bot where you send it query text and based on that it gives you suggestions. An example is a transit bot where you can ask it when is the next train and it will return the list of stations, something you could implement on your company website.

A bot with another function is one that set up meetings or post messages to your slack channel. Please checkout the post on connecting Pipedrive to a Slack channel: Connect Pipedrive to a Slack Channel Using a Bot Other bots could leveraging the NLP (Natural Language Processing) on the platform. For instance a bot that searches for pictures as soon as you ask for it in a Facebook chat.

On the `Facebook Messenger Platform` page to generate the "Page Access Token", first select the facebook page you just created for your bot. A popup will ask you to verify the permission for the app.

Copy the token and store it in a safe place.


Go to your app dashboard, copy the APP ID and App Secret as well. You will need them to configure the bot later.

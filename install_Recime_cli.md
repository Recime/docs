# Install Recime-CLI

We support cross OS platform development, prepping your system is per platform a bit different. But the requirements are the same.

For Windows OS systems, [Prep your Windows system for Recime](/windows_install_recime_cli.md)

For MacOS systems, [Prep your Apple system for Recime](/macos_install_recime_cli.md)


After this you will have everything to get started: 

> A Code editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/)
>
> [Go](https://golang.org/) installed and configured

The `Recime Command Line Tool`, installed, and configured

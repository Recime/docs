Enter title, description of the of the bot. Upload an icon (256x256),
choose your channel and language.

Press "Submit".

This will create a bot using the default template with ``start``,
``default`` and ``about`` block.

Blocks are the building blocks of your bot. A block contains expressions
and responses. You can also trigger a block by a user event (e.g.button
click) or by user input.

Go to the "Responses" tab, make some changes and test your bot in
real-time.

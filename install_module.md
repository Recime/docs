# Install Module (Photo Bot Specific)

We are using request module which you can install by typing the following command in terminal or command window:


    npm  install request --save


The --save flag will have it in package.json under dependencies this will ensure that `recime-cli`  installs in any missing packages during the build process.


If you want to know more, please checkout `https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/` on how to install and save modules using node package manager.

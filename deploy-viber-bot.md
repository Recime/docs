# Deploy

Go to your terminal and type the following command:

```
recime config viber

```

Paste your `viber` auth token (a.k.a. app key) and hit enter.

Deploy the bot by typing the following command:

```
recime deploy

```

This will build any external `npm` packages you have used, including native modules, deploy the bot in the cloud and configure the `viber` integration automatically.

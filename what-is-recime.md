## About Recime

*You can concentrate on the actual functionality of your bot, we will take care of the rest.*

Typically building bots requires a developer to spin up their own Node server, wire up the corresponding SDKs, manually integrate NLP, fiddle with API access tokens, and then host it all somewhere, and that's just for one service, imagine you have your bot on multiple platforms. Recime (/ˈresəˌmē/) is a cloud based bot infrastructure back-end and hosting platform for developers (BoTaaS). Recime handles all the plumbing a bot developer runs into and provides with its JavaScript framework all the required infrastructure necessary to build a rich bot with built-in natural language processing. It will save you hours of development hours.

At Recime you can build bots with different functions, for instance a bot where you send it query text and based on that it gives you suggestions. An example is a transit bot where you can ask it when is the next train and it will return the list of stations, something you could implement on your company website.
A bot with another function is one that set up meetings or post messages to your slack channel. Please checkout the post on connecting Pipedrive to a Slack channel: Connect [Pipedrive to a Slack Channel Using a Bot](https://medium.com/fusion-by-fresco-capital/connect-pipedrive-to-a-slack-channel-using-a-bot-f6f0ba32df3a#.rfa58humr). Other bots could leveraging the NLP (Natural Language Processing) on the platform. For instance a [bot that searches for pictures](https://docs.recime.ai/facebook_bot.html) as soon as you ask for it in a Facebook chat

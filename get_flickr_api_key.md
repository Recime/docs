# Get Flickr API Key

In order to make photos queries in flickr, first get your flickr API key from:  
`https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/ (use the “I'd rather use my own email address” version if you don’t want to set up a yahoo account)`

Once you have it, you can later on paste it in your search query along with the query text you have extracted from keywords

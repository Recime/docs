# Installation

`Recime Command Line Tool` is written in [Go](https://golang.org) with support for multiple platforms.


The latest release can be found at [Recime Releases](https://github.com/Recime/recime-cli/releases). 

Recime CLI may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9 and Solaris. See http://golang.org/doc/install/source for the full set of supported combinations of target operating systems and compilation architectures.


On macOS, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), installation is even easier, just type the following command:

```
brew tap recime/tools && brew install recime-cli

```

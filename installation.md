# Installation

`Recime Command Line Tool` is written in [Go](https://golang.org) with support for multiple platforms.


The latest release can be found at [Recime Releases](https://github.com/Recime/recime-cli/releases). We currently provide pre-built binaries for  Windows and macOS.

Recime CLI may also be compiled from source wherever the Go compiler tool chain can run, e.g. for other operating systems including DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9 and Solaris. See http://golang.org/doc/install/source for the full set of supported combinations of target operating systems and compilation architectures.


On macOS, if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), installation is even easier, just type the following command:

```
brew tap recime/tools && brew install recime-cli

```

On Windows, if you have [Choco](https://chocolatey.org), just run `choco install recime-cli`.

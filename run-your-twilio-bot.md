# Run your Bot

Send a message to the number, you have just setup and everything should be working as expected if you setup the webhook correctly as mentioned in the previous section. `text` property is handled like any other platform therefore if you are sending the following `json`, it should work without any code change as for any other supported platform.

```
  {
    text : "Hello World"
  }

```

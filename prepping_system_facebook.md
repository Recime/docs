#Prepping your System


We support cross OS platform development, prepping your system is per platform a bit different. But the requirements are the same.

To get started, you will need a few tools installed on your system like a Code editor, Go and Recime-cli.

If you donâ€™t have these yet, we made OS specific guides:


For Apple OS systems, [Prep your Apple system for Recime](/macos.md)

For Windows OS systems, [Prep your Windows system for Recime](/windows.md)

#Setup Twilio

The first step is to create a new `Programmable SMS Messaging` Service. Do this by scrolling down on the home dashboard and select Programmable SMS under the Messaging section.

Next create a messaging service. Name it whatever you want.

The only setting we need to set is the inbound request URL. Simply copy/paste the bot endpoint.

Save the messaging service using the Save button at the bottom of the screen.


Add a phone number for this service by clicking the Numbers menu on the left.

If you already have a number you'd like to use, choose that, otherwise create a new one.


That's it the bot is now ready for SMS.
